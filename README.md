# WEBSERV
###42 Cursus project - Webserv: This is a team project, my partner on it was [dperez42](https://github.com/dperez42).

In this projects we must create an operative HTTP server in C++ 98 without Boost or any external library. We take nginx as reference to compare headers and answer behaviors. We must have GET, POST and DELETE methods working properly on it. As all the projects in 42 Madrid it is developed to work properly in macOS.

For more info about you can check the complete list of funtional requirements in [spanish](INFO/es.subject.pdf) or [english](en.subject.pdf).
